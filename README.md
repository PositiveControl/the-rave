### Premise 1 (idea 1)
Dealers acquire candy for $PAPER (or another in-game *only* currency, denominated in $PAPER). All roles arrive in the 
Parking Lot, dealers have the opportunity sell candy in the parking lot, the line, and all locations within the rave/party.
Dealers must avoid: 

1. Getting caught selling candy by Security or Cops => Cop Car => Jail
2. Selling directly to an undercover Cop => Cop Car => Jail
3. Selling too much to a single Kid => EMS being called and party shut down by Cops
4. Accepting fake money (black light test)
5. Buying/Selling bunk candy (fake)
6. Getting jacked

- Parties last a set amount of time (e.g. a round)
- Dealers can carry a finite amount of candy, once sold out, they have to return to their Parking Lot stash or buy from another dealer at the rave (Hustler)
- The more $PAPER and Candy you carry, the higher the risk of getting caught when going through The Line
- Dealers must consume water (and red bulls) for energy, otherwise they fall into cuddle puddle and get jacked
- If a Dealer eats his own supply, he'll immediately have more Kids around to sell to, but has a much higher risk of taking fake money, giving away free samples, getting caught by Cops, and ultimately overdosing.
- Dealing in each location has different risks:
  - e.g
    - Parking Lot - Higher risks: getting jacked, Cops; Lower risks/benefits: Security, buy/sell larger quantities, better prices 
    - The Line - HRisk: Security, Cops, LRisk: Kids ODing, fake money, getting jacked
    - Bathroom - HRisk: getting jacked, dropping candy in the toilet/sink/pissy floor; Lower risks/benefits: cops or fake money
